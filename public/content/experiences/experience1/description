Hired by the start-up technology company, pathVu, Inc. which provides tools for city planners and pedestrians to make walkways more accessible, I developed an ArcGIS-enabled WPF application to connect collected sidewalk quality data with GPS coordinates and GIS objects.<br/><br/>
In addition, using C# and Visual Studio, I created an application to automate uploading local files to AWS.
<br/><br/>Currently, I am working on a WPF tool to generate sidewalk width measurements from collected images.
