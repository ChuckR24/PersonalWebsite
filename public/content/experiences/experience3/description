I worked on a small team to create the first versions of the <a href="http://pathvu.com/why_sidewalknav.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PathVu mobile app</a>. I was responsible for working on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owner.pathvuinterface&hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android app</a> and my work required knowledge in Java, Android Studio, and XML.
