Having worked as the Design Lead for HackCWRU 2019 and 2020, I continued to serve on the Executive team for the planned 2021 hackathon. In Spring 2020 while taking EECS 341: Introduction to Database Systems, two classmates and I created a hackathon registration and judging system as our final project.
