This is a scraper for the Google Play Store that I wrote to speed up data collection for a research project I was assisting with. For each app in a given list of google play store app id's, this program can scrape:<br/><br/> 1) The list of permissions used in the app<br/><br/> 2) The link to the app's privacy policy<br/><br/> 3) The privacy policy itself (converting if it is a pdf) as a .txt file<br/><br/> 4) The total number of apps from the given set which used each permission<br/><br/>The program also includes code to automate the counting of certain types of files related to the data scraped. I wrote this project in Java as it is one of my strongest languages and used libraries such as <a href="https://jsoup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jsoup</a>, <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a>, and <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache PDFBoxÂ®.</a>
