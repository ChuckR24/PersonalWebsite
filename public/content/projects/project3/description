From Aug 2018 to Aug 2020, I was the Design Lead and Website Developer for the <a   href="https://case.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CWRU</a> annual hackathon, HackCWRU. After taking on the leadership position in my first semester of college, I was responsible for designing the website, merchendise, and all promotional materials for the event. Furthermore, I led a small team of student developers in using <a   href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactJS</a> to build the event website. <a   href="https://hackcwru2020-web.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2020 site </a>can still be viewed as it remains hosted on <a   href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Firebase</a>.
