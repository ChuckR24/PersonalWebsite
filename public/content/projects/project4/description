My latest project is the website you are currently viewing. It serves to exhibit my technical skills as well as give coworkers and employers a better idea of the kind of programmer I am. As I complete my final CWRU coursework as well as take on new challenges, I will continue to update and improve this site. Any advice or suggestions would be highly appreciated!
