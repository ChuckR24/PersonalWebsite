<p>
    I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 2022 as a Computer Science major with minors in Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy. My varied experiences have made me a highly adaptable worker and always ready to learn a new skill for the needs of my team. My passion for my work comes from the challenge it provides and the potential it holds. I find few things as exciting as talking to others about their interests and brainstorming about how technology could help them do what they love.
    
    <br/><br />A problem solver in the most general sense, I seek to improve the world around me and create meaningful experiences with technology. I excel in roles requring high degrees of independence, accountability, and communication. Currently, I work full-time at <a href="https://www.omnicell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omnicell</a> as a software engineer where I regularly work with Angular, APIs, databases, kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
