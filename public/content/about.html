<p>
    I am a computer science student at Case Western Reserve University expected to graduate in May 2022. Currently, I work as a junior developer at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pathvu/">pathVu, Inc.</a> My varied experiences have made me a highly
    adaptable worker, always ready to learn a new skill for the needs of my team. My passion for my work comes from the challenge it provides and the potential it holds. Talking to others about their interests and brainstorming about how technology could
    help them do what they love is one of my favorite things in life. <br/><br />I consider my self a problem solver in the most general sense, and feel improve the world around me. My willingness to take on new challenges has led to my recent success
    at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pathvu/">pathVu, Inc.</a>, where over the course of 8 months, I learned C#, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-5.0">WPF</a> development, <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview">ArcGIS</a>,
    and AWS. In this time, I completed 3 applications that will streamline data gathering and processing for both the company and their clients. Additionally, in this experience I worked remotely and thus conducted my own research and self-teaching to
    deliver the tools I set out to create.<br /><br /> I excel in roles requring high degrees of independence, accountability, and communication. Currently, I am looking to secure an exciting, impactful internship experience for Summer 2021. Get in touch
