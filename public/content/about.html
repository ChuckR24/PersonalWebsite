<p>
    I am a student at Case Western Reserve University expecting to graduate in May 2022. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with minors in Philosophy and Artifical Intelligence. Currently, I work as a junior developer at <a href="http://pathvu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pathVu, Inc.</a> My varied experiences have made me a highly adaptable worker, always ready to learn a new skill for the needs of my team. My passion for my work comes from the challenge it provides and the potential it holds. Talking to others about their interests and brainstorming about how technology could help them do what they love is one of my favorite things in life. 
    
    <br/><br />A problem solver in the most general sense, I seek to improve the world around me. My willingness to take on new challenges has led to my recent success at <a href="http://pathvu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pathVu, Inc.</a>, where over the course of 8 months, I learned C#, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WPF</a> development, <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArcGIS</a>, and AWS. During this time, I completed 3 applications that will streamline data gathering and processing for both the company and their clients. Additionally, in this experience I worked remotely and thus conducted my own research and self-teaching to
    deliver the tools I set out to create.
    
    <br /><br />I excel in roles requring high degrees of independence, accountability, and communication. Currently, I am looking to secure an exciting, impactful internship experience for Summer 2021. An ideal role would allow me to both test and improve my technical and professional skills. <a href="#CONTACT-section">Get in touch with me</a> <!--at <em>chuck dot j dot rakaczky at gmail.com</em-->to find how I can contribute to your team!</br></br>
