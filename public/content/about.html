<p>
    I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 2022 as a Computer Science major with minors in Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with minors in Philosophy and Artifical Intelligence. My varied experiences have made me a highly adaptable worker and always ready to learn a new skill for the needs of my team. My passion for my work comes from the challenge it provides and the potential it holds. I find few things as exciting as talking to others about their interests and brainstorming about how technology could help them do what they love.
    
    <br/><br />A problem solver in the most general sense, I seek to improve the world around me. I excel in roles requring high degrees of independence, accountability, and communication. My willingness to take on new challenges has led to my recent success at <a href="https://www.omnicell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omnicell</a>, where over the course of three months, I picked up Angular JS, built upon my understanding of website performance and how to improve it, and contributed to an Agile development cycle alongside senior engineers. During this time, I learned and then used Angular to standardize styling across 4 different projects to Angular Material styling. To improve site performance, I optimized a number of queries in our API. Additionally, I investigated and eliminated redundant API calls on core site pages, saving seconds of load time. 
    
    <br /><br />Currently, I am excited to join Omnicell full-time as a software engineer after graduation. <a href="#CONTACT-section">Get in touch with me</a> to find out more about my experience, projects, and passion for the work I do.</br></br>
